It lowers the threshold for linking everyday life with science teaching in schools by technology.\r\n\r\nweSPOT supports the meaningful contextualization of scientific concepts by relating them to personal curiosity, experiences, and reasoning. weSPOT addresses several challenges in the area of science learning and technology support for building personal conceptual knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on inquiry-based learning with a theoretically sound and technology supported personal inquiry approach. In inquiry based-learning learners take the role of an explorer and scientist and are motivated by their personal curiosity, guided by self-reflection, and develop knowledge personal and collaborative sense-making and reasoning.\r\n\r\nweSPOT will work on a meta-inquiry level in that it will (a) define a reference model for inquiry-based learning skills, (b) create a diagnostic instrument for measuring inquiry skills, and (c) implement a working environment that allows the easy linking of inquiry activities with school curricula and legacy systems. weSPOT [1]is supported by the European Commission.\r\n\r\n##weSPOT system components\r\n\r\n* [Inquiry Workflow Engine] (http://wespot.github.io/wespot_iwe/) The Inquiry Workflow Engine is the base system for the whole weSPOT inquiry toolkit.\r\n* [PIM Android](http://wespot.github.io/wespot_pim_android/) gives mobile access to weSPOT inquiries on android.\r\n* [Learning Analytics Reflection and Awareness Dashboards (LARAe)] (http://wespot.github.io/learningdashboard/) provides both teacher and students with a visualisation of the activities performed in the Inquiry Workflow Engine.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
