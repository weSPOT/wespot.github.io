<a id="welcome-to-wespot" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-wespot" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to weSPOT</h3>

<p>weSPOT aims at propagating scientific inquiry as the approach for science learning and teaching in combination with today's curricula and teaching practices. It lowers the threshold for linking everyday life with science teaching in schools by technology.</p>

<p>weSPOT supports the meaningful contextualization of scientific concepts by relating them to personal curiosity, experiences, and reasoning. weSPOT addresses several challenges in the area of science learning and technology support for building personal conceptual knowledge.</p>

<p>The project focuses on inquiry-based learning with a theoretically sound and technology supported personal inquiry approach. In inquiry based-learning learners take the role of an explorer and scientist and are motivated by their personal curiosity, guided by self-reflection, and develop knowledge personal and collaborative sense-making and reasoning.</p>

<p>weSPOT will work on a meta-inquiry level in that it will (a) define a reference model for inquiry-based learning skills, (b) create a diagnostic instrument for measuring inquiry skills, and (c) implement a working environment that allows the easy linking of inquiry activities with school curricula and legacy systems. weSPOT [1]is supported by the European Commission.</p>

<a id="overview-of-software-architecture" class="anchor" href="#overview-of-software-architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview of Software architecture</h2>

<p>The weSPOT software system architecture contains several layers from data management layer, control services, to application layers. The application layer contains the mina application with which different end users interact.</p>

<ul>
<li>The inquiry web application is based on elgg open source software and is the main application for setting up confoguring and web-based interaction with inquiry data.</li>
<li>Furthermore the mobile clients developed in workpackage 4 of weSPOT enable the spontaonous creation of data collections and also inquiries, as also the planned collection of data driven by data collection tasks configured in the web-based application. Furthermore the inquiry coordination interface enables users to get performance data on their inquiries as how much data is collected, what are the activities of the participants.</li>
<li>The diagnostic instrument enables the personal analysis of the level of inquiry skills</li>
<li>The collaboration and reflection clients enable the personal and collaborative reflection and discussion of learners and teachers on the ongoing inquiries.</li>
</ul>
